<h1>Activity: Classify the assets connected to a home network</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
In this lab activity, I undertook the essential task of classifying assets within a home office network, emphasizing the critical role of asset management in an organization's security plan. Asset management involves the meticulous tracking of assets and assessing the risks that impact them. The process commenced with the creation of an asset inventory, a comprehensive catalog outlining the assets requiring protection. Subsequently, I engaged in the crucial step of classifying assets based on their significance and sensitivity to risk. Recognizing the importance of this activity in fortifying security measures, I ensured its completion before progressing further. The upcoming course item promises a completed exemplar for comparison, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of my asset classification efforts.
